You are required to create an animation. 
Develop this program using empty HTML page with no
CSS properties used [No CSS files]. 

You are only allowed to use JavaScript.

There is a bar at top of the page with background color yellow 
and text ‘Task 2’ is placed between the bar. The bar gets 
transparent within some time and appears again in opaque
condition through linear transition. There are random number
of bubbles [3-10] with shadow that appear on the page in random 
places (as shown in the picture [Task2samplepic.PNG]). The bubbles get bigger and 
rate of increase in size is different for all of them and is 
totally random. When a bubble reaches height and width equal 
to 100px, it bursts and disappears. Once all bubbles on screen 
have disappeared, the program creates new set of random bubbles 
and so on.
